state law in the nation to require commercial websites and 
online services to post a privacy policy. The law's reach 
stretches well beyond California to require any person or company

websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post 
a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the 
information being collected and those individuals or companies with whom 
it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf You

collection of personal information from children under the age of

what operators of websites and online services must do to 
protect children's privacy and safety online. CAN SPAM Act The 
CAN-SPAM Act is a law that sets the rules for 
commercial email, establishes requirements for commercial messages, gives recipients the 
right to have emails stopped from being sent to them,
