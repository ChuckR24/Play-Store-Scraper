Our software doesn't collect any information that we are aware 
of; some information for all Android apps on your device 
is sent to Google, and we have access to this 
information for our apps - it looks like we have 
information on crashes, etc. It doesn't seem like we have 
access to any personal information through Google, but anyway, we 
promise we wouldn't do anything with it even if we 
did. Your privacy is safe from us :)
