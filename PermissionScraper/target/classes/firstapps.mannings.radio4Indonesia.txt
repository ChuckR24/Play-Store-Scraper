Privacy Policy Your privacy is very important to us and 
we make sure to only ask for permissions we really 
need to give you the best possible experience using the 
app. WHICH PERMISSIONS DOES THE RADIO APP USE AND WHY? 
Storage: We use this permission to store buffer and cache 
streams as they play and reduce network communication to improve 
performance. This permission does not give us access to your 
photos or videos. Phone: allows the app to know when 
you receive or end a phone call. This prevents our 
app from interrupting your calls and allows us to resume 
play when you hang up. Prevent device from sleeping: We 
need this permission in order to keep the screen on 
when necessary. View network connections: we need this permission to 
get the Wifi status of your device to determine whether 
you have an active connection. Full network access: stream to 
your phone. Wi-Fi connection information: We need this permission to 
get the Wi-Fi status of your device to determine whether 
you have an active connection. Ad companies may collect anonymous 
data through our services. Advertising companies may collect completely anonymous 
data through our service for solely ad targeting. Your acceptance

acceptance of this policy. If you do not agree to 
this policy, please do not use our apps. Your continued 
use of the Apps following the posting of changes to 
this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
