Development Home Apps Privacy Policy About Website Mobile applications Privacy 
Policy for Mobile Applications This Privacy Policy describes how Crunchy 
ByteBox = Software Development Wenzl ('I', 'my', 'me') and my 
third parties partner collect and use data when you use 
my apps. By using my apps, you agree to this 
Privacy Policy. Do not install / uninstall the app if 
you do not agree with this Privacy Policy. First of 
all I'm publishing three different types of apps: paid apps, 
free apps and free apps with in-app purchases. Paid apps 
are completely ad-free versions of some free apps and additionally 
come with some extra features. Third parties are not involved 
and no kind of data is collected. Free apps are 
free of charge and use banner advertising provided by me 
(for other Crunchy ByteBox apps) and by third parties (so 
you don't have to pay for my apps). Free apps 
with in-app purchases are free apps with the option to 
remove all ads by purchasing the corresponding in-app product ('Remove 
ads') via Google Billing Services. They may come with other 
in-app produst to upgrade the app. Use of Data 'Personal 
data' is information that identifies you or another person, including 
but not limited to your name, address, email address, IP 
address. 'Non-personal data' is information that does not identify you 
or another person, i.e. device information, hardware model. Since all 
my apps are distributed via Google Play Store by Google 
Inc., I encourage you to read Google's privacy policy: www.google.com/policies/privacy. 
I, the publisher, have access to general, non-personal data for 
statistical information provided by Google. This includes information like download, 
install, uninstall numbers and country, language, device model, carrier and 
app version. The data is non-personal and I can not 
link this data to an individual person. Paid Apps: I 
do not collect, store or share personal or non-personal data. 
Free apps (with and without in-app products) display my own 
ads for other Crunchy ByteBox apps AND advertisement by third 
parties. I and third parties may collect and store personal 
and non-personal data. Please read the paragraph 'Ad Serving' for 
more information about your shared data and how interest-based ads 
can be disabled. Ad Serving (ONLY applying for free apps 
- with and without in-app products) Crunchy ByteBox I may 
show banner ads to promote other apps by Crunchy ByteBox. 
By clicking the ad and confirming to proceed you will 
be forwarded to Google's Play Store, to the app's download 
page. Your IP address is used to deliver and display 
my ad on your device. Further I receive only non-personal 
data like (but not limited to) your device model, android 
version, language information. Neither your IP address nor any other 
data is collected or shared. All information is exclusively used 
to display ad for Crunchy ByteBox apps. Third parties: AdMob, 
Google Inc. and its partners ('my partners') I offer free-of-charge 
apps that display banner advertising provided by my partners that 
link to their advertising service. My partners may use ad 
serving technologies (advertising identifiers) that perform similar functions like cookies. 
Personal data (like your IP address) and non-personal data (like 
device model, sensors in your device) may be disclosed to, 
collected and stored by my partners. Advertising identifiers and your 
data is used and saved by my partners to (but 
not limited to) coordinate ads across your apps and browser, 
to measure ad performance, to make advertising more effective and 
show interest-based ads. I have access to anonymous and limited 
statistical information about the use of my apps from my 
partners. You can disable interest-based ads: open your 'Google Settings' 
app on your device, select 'Google' and tab 'Ads', switch 
'Opt out of interest-based ads'. Please note, you will still 
receive advertisement and it may be based on factors like 
your general location from your IP address. Please take note 
of our partners' privacy policy as they operate under their 
own policies: www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners www.google.com/policies/technologies/ads www.google.com/policies/privacy App Permissions Paid apps: Only 
permissions that are necessary to run the apps are requested. 
Permissions are exclusively used for the apps' internal processes. Please 
take note of the info about sd card permission below.

advertisement (see section 'Ad Serving' above). All other permissions are 
needed for the functionality and the features my apps offer.

permission is used to save data (like a taken picture) 
on your device. Saving data to your storage means that 
other applications may read the saved data. Your Rights Right
