STUDIO PRIVACY POLICY This policy describes how Promedia Studio (collectively 
described as “we”, “us” or “our”) collects, uses, processes and 
shares information about you. This privacy policy applies to all 
of our apps used on mobile devices. It also applies 
to advertising activities and other services that we may provide. 
Our apps are free to play and in order to 
maintain a high quality game experience we process information from 
you. LAST UPDATED This privacy policy was last updated on 
29.05.2019. INFORMATION WE COLLECT We collect little information about you 
when you play our apps. Most of this data comes 
directly from you, such as device hardware information, country and 
region, and game play information (time spent playing our apps). 
We use this data to provide high quality apps to 
you, for purposes of optimisation such as making sure our 
apps work on all devices and are as enjoyable as 
possible to all the players. Below you can find a 
short list with the information we collect: * Device information: 
We collect information about the device you use to access 
our apps, including information about the device’s software and hardware; 
* Usage: Information relating to your use, the time you 
spend playing our apps; The information above is processed in 
order to maintain and provide the apps and game experience.

performance of a contract to which you are party in 
order to support the operation of our apps, facilitate the 
delivery of requested products and services and enable maintenance and 
update of the apps, see Article 6(1)(b) of the GDPR. 
You have the right to object to our processing of 
your personal data on grounds relating to your particular situation 
when the data are processed based on the balancing-of-interest rule 
in Section 6(1)(f) of the GDPR, see Article 21 of 
the GDPR. In this case, we will cease the processing 
unless there are compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which 
override your interests, rights and freedoms or if the processing 
is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal 
claims. INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES We may process information from 
advertising platforms and partners and other third parties who have 
obtained your consent or have another legal right to share 
such information with us. This may include attributes about you

apps may include advertising for third party products and services. 
We and our advertising partners will use information about you

can show you relevant third party ads in our games. 
We work with advertising partners that may collect information from 
you as part of their process of serving relevant advertisements 
in our products. In conformity with the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR), our advertising partners in the European Economic Area 
(EEA) all function as independent data controllers. You will be 
asked whether you consent to share your information with the 
advertising company, in order to show you personalized ads. If 
you are a resident of an EEA country and indicate 
that you are below the age of 16, you will 
be provided with non-personalized ads and the advertising companies will 
not collect personal information from you. This privacy policy does 
not apply to the collection of your information by our 
advertising partners. We strongly recommend that you review our advertising 
partner’s privacy policies for more information: 1. https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en 2. https://unity3d.com/legal/privacy-policy

collected from your device; * demographic and interests based information 
that we might acquire from third parties who have obtained 
your consent or have another legal right to share that

we and our advertising partners will use information about you 
to improve advertising, targeting and measurement systems so that we 
can show you relevant third party ads in our games.

Studio is processed on the basis of your consent. You 
are able to refuse or withdraw consent without detriment, at

ads will not be targeted using information that we hold 
about you and will be less relevant to you. YOUR
