This Policy This policy describes the personal information MTBC collects 
about you, why MTBC collects it and how MTBC uses 
it. MTBC's policy also describes the choices you can make 
about how MTBC collects and uses your information. About MTBC, 
Inc. MTBC is a leading provider of proprietary, cloud-based healthcare 
IT solutions and services. MTBC provides a comprehensive product portfolio 
of a fully integrated suite of web-based solutions, together with 
related business services to healthcare providers. What Information Does MTBC 
Collect? We may collect the information you provide us while 
accessing, requesting or signing up for services from us on 
our Website. If you are interested in learning more about 
MTBC and the services and products we offer, we may 
ask for personal information, such as your name, practice name 
and size, email address, telephone number, and city/state. If you 
are an existing client and use our cloud-based EHR, we 
may also collect your username or other information (e.g., Practice 
ID) you use to log into or access your account. 
We do not collect or process any sensitive data such 
as: race or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or philosophical 
beliefs; trade union memberships; genetic or biometric data; health or 
mortality; or sexual orientation in connection with this Website. When 
you visit our Website, we may gather certain information about 
your visit and your device automatically. This information may, for 
example, reflect how you found, were directed to or used 
this Website. Similarly, we may collect your IP address, browser 
type and version, and other data about the equipment used 
to visit the Website, as well as the patterns of 
searching and browsing that preceded access to the Website, and 
the patterns of searching and browsing on the Website. The 
Website does not respond to web browsers' Do Not Track 
signals. Thus, your selection of the "do not track" option 
provided by your browser may not have any effect on 
our collection of cookie information for analytic and internal purposes. 
What Does MTBC Do With the Information it Collects? This 
information is collected to help MTBC further develop its services, 
to provide access to valuable information and services, and to 
improve the functionality of our website. We track the number 
of visitors to our website and make changes to the 
portions most frequently visited to improve user functionality. We analyze 
the ways users are directed to our website to improve 
advertising as well as enhance quality and methods of advertising. 
If Personal Identifiable Information is submitted, we use the information 
at the time of collection for business purposes. For example: 
Email addresses – if email addresses are provided, we may 
use them for marketing, promotional and information purposes, such as, 
invitations, newsletters, marketing, and announcements. We may also share email 
addresses with partners and affiliates for their own marketing purposes, 
but will never share information with unaffiliated third parties. Passive 
Information Collection/Use of Cookies A cookie is a small text 
file that is stored on a user's computer for record-keeping 
purposes. Cookies are used on this site. We do not 
link the information we store in cookies to any personally 
identifiable information you submit while on our site. We use 
session ID cookies to make it easier for you to 
navigate our site. A session ID cookie expires when you 
close your browser. A persistent cookie remains on your hard 
drive for an extended period of time. You can remove 
cookies by following directions in your Internet browser's "help" file. 
To learn more about cookies, please visit this link: Microsoft 
Cookies. As users navigate through a website, certain information can 
be passively collected (that is, gathered without the user actively 
providing the information), using various technologies and means, such as 
Internet Protocol addresses, cookies, Internet tags, and navigational data collection. 
MTBC uses Internet Protocol (IP) addresses on this site. An 
IP address is a number assigned to a computer by 
the Internet service provider so that it may access the 
Internet. It is generally considered to be non-personally identifiable information 
because, in most cases, an IP address is dynamic (changing 
each time you connect to the Internet), rather than static 
(unique to a particular user's computer). MTBC uses an IP 
address to diagnose problems with its server, report aggregate information 
and determine the fastest route for your computer to use 
in connecting to our site in order to administer and 
improve the website functionality. MTBC logs IP addresses, or the 
location of your computer on the Internet, for systems administration 
and troubleshooting purposes. Log data is used in the aggregate 
to analyze usage of the website and may be used 
to contact you for purposes of promoting MTBC products or 
services. Your data will not be sold to, shared with, 
or otherwise made available to any third parties. If you 
reject cookies, you may still use our site, but your 
ability to use some areas of our site, will be 
limited. Security MTBC servers are housed in a well-monitored and 
secure data center. Moreover, data protection mechanisms, security layers and 
data encryption measures have been implemented to prevent unauthorized access. 
All PHI, as well as demographic information, is password protected 
and encrypted within the relevant databases. It is important for 
users to protect their password and computer from unauthorized access. 
When users submit personal information to the secure areas of 
MTBC's website, MTBC encrypts it using Secure Sockets Layer ("SSL"), 
a software encryption technology. Encryption protects information against unauthorized access 
and modification once it is stored in the database. Privacy 
Policy Updates MTBC reserves the right to make periodic updates 
and revisions to this policy, at any time. If we 
decide to change our privacy policy, we will post those 
changes to this privacy statement and other places we deem 
appropriate so that you are aware of what information we 
collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if 
any, we disclose it. PRIVACY NOTICE FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS Furthermore,
